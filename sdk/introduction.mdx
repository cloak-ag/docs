## Installation

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install @cloak.ag/sdk @solana/web3.js
```

```bash yarn
yarn add @cloak.ag/sdk @solana/web3.js
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm add @cloak.ag/sdk @solana/web3.js
```

```bash bun
bun add @cloak.ag/sdk @solana/web3.js
```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
For swap functionality, also install `@solana/spl-token`.
</Note>

## Quick example

```typescript
import { CloakSDK, getDistributableAmount } from "@cloak.ag/sdk";
import { Connection, Keypair, PublicKey } from "@solana/web3.js";

// Initialize
const sdk = new CloakSDK({
  keypairBytes: keypair.secretKey, // or wallet adapter
  network: "devnet",
});

// Deposit SOL
const { note } = await sdk.deposit(connection, 100_000_000);

// Withdraw privately
await sdk.withdraw(connection, note, recipient, { withdrawAll: true });
```

## Key features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Private transfers** | Send SOL with ZK proofs - no on-chain link between sender and recipient |
| **Multi-recipient** | Split to up to 5 recipients in one transaction |
| **Token swaps** | Swap SOL → USDC/other tokens privately |
| **On-chain proofs** | No indexer needed - proofs computed from chain state |
| **Cross-platform** | Works in Node.js, React, Next.js, React Native |

---

## Network support

| Network | Status | Program ID |
|---------|--------|------------|
| Mainnet | Soon | `c1oak6tetxYnNfvXKFkpn1d98FxtK7B68vBQLYQpWKp` |
| Devnet | Live | `c1oak6tetxYnNfvXKFkpn1d98FxtK7B68vBQLYQpWKp` |
| Localnet | Supported | Deploy your own |

---

<Tip>
The SDK computes Merkle proofs directly from on-chain state, eliminating the need for an external indexer service. This improves reliability and decentralization.
</Tip>

## Fee structure

| Fee type | Amount | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| Fixed fee | 0.005 SOL | Base fee per withdrawal |
| Variable fee | 0.3% | Percentage of deposit amount |

```typescript
import { getDistributableAmount, calculateFee } from "@cloak.ag/sdk";

const deposited = 100_000_000; // 0.1 SOL
const fee = calculateFee(deposited);           // 5,300,000 lamports
const afterFees = getDistributableAmount(deposited); // 94,700,000 lamports
```

## Security model

<Warning>
**Protect your notes!** A Cloak Note contains spending secrets. Anyone with the note can withdraw the funds. Treat notes like private keys.
</Warning>

| Guarantee | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Transaction privacy** | On-chain observers cannot link deposits to withdrawals |
| **Amount privacy** | Individual amounts hidden in the anonymity set |
| **Double-spend protection** | Nullifiers prevent reusing notes |
| **Proof verification** | All withdrawals require valid ZK proofs |
